)
```

>*We highly recommend that you follow the order of the items proposed in this tutorial*!

## Install R
*R* is the core piece of software that we need and we certainly wouldn't be able to do anything without a proper and recent version installed on our computers. 

> If your computer was a plane, we may think of R as the engine and propeller

### How to install R
The best way is to follow the instructions in this video (*1 min 30s*)

)
```

## Install RStudio
RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It means that RStudio helps you write and work with R in a very intuitive and simple way.  

> If your computer was a plane, we may think of RStudio as the cockpit  

### How to install RStudio

 RStudio makes editing, programming and visualizing in R much easier and we highly recommend that you install it and use it.  
 
 For that, follow the instructions in this video (*50 sec*)

    answer("No.", message = "R does not come with RStudio; you need to install R separately. It is best to start by installing R and then RStudio.")
  )
)
```

## Install Packages
The R community is very active and has created many packages, each solving a different problem. There are hundreds of packages created each month and we should take advantages of this packages to avoid reinventing the wheel. 

> If your computer was a plane, we may think of the packages as all the components needed to fly (landing gear, gyroscope, lights, GPS, ... )

## A short tutorial on R

###  Basic R syntax

Let us define some elements to play with: 

```{r}
# Here I define a numerical variable 
myage <- 25

# And I can show it
myage
```

Now if I want to make it pretty, I can use the `paste()` function.  This function is quite useful for presenting results, titles, etc; as it *paste* text ( within quotes "  ") and other R objects (here a number). 

```{r, prepÃ¢re}
paste("My age is", myage)

```


> R is **case sensitive**, which means that we have to be careful about how we name our objects and recall them 

***What will the following code return?** 
  
```{r, eval= FALSE}
MyAge <- 45
paste("My age is", myage)
```


```{r Case, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("My age is 45",
                message = "Well, that would true be if ***MyAge*** and ***myage***  are similar. But since R is case sensitive, these two objects are different"),
         answer("My age is 25", message = " Well-done", correct = TRUE),
         answer("25",
                message = "No, We used `paste()` to heave a sentence that assemble the text \"My age is\" and the value"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Try it by yourself and click on the `Run Code`  blue button. You can modify the code to change value, rename the objects *myage*, *MyAge etc.  

```{r tryit, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE }
myage <- 25
MyAge <- 45

paste("My age is", myage)
```


### Objects

In R everything is an **object**. This means that an element may embed some other *"things"*

> Let's create objects!

#### Vectors

Vectors can be create (and conceived) as a concatenation of numbers. We use The c()`  function to concatenate objects.

```{r}
# Let's create a vector
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
# And another one 
b <- c(4, 5, 6)

mystring <- c(a, b)

mystring
```

We have a double concatenation here since `c(1,2,3)`is already a concatenate object (a vector here)

> But we can also concatenate things that are of **different nature**! 

***What will the following code return?** 
```{r , eval= FALSE}
myobject <- c("A" , 1 )
myobject

```


```{r Concat, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("A1",
                message = "Well, not quite"),
         answer(" \"A \" \"1\" ", message = " Well-done", correct = TRUE),
         answer("An error",
                message = "No, We can really concatenate different things "),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


### Data Frames

A data frame is the equivalent of a tabular, where we store data in rows and columns. We will use these structures a lot, and as any object in R, we can access to its different component with different methods

> Let's create data frames and play with them!

```{r}
# Creating a data frame
mydata <- data.frame(name = c("John", "Sokol", "Chris"),
                     age = c(25, 30, 28),
                     student = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))
```

We have lots of tools to play with data frames


```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Here we have the first lines of this very small data frame
head(mydata)
```


The **structure** of the data frame is given by `str()` function. It is very important to identify which variable is numerical or  integer, or a character (string) or a Boolean (TRUE/FALSE) as some operations will only apply for some *type* of variables.

```{r}
str(mydata)
```

We can also extract information from the data frame

***What will the following code return?** 
  
```{r, eval= FALSE}
mydata[1,]
```


```{r extract, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("The first row of mydata (John 25 TRUE) ", message = " Well-done", correct = TRUE),
         answer("The first column of mydata with all names (John Sokol Chris) ",
                message = "No, but that was close"),
          answer("The first element of mydata (John)",
                message = "No, try again"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Check it out by yourself

```{r mydata, exercise = TRUE}
# run this code to find out! 
mydata[1,]

```

We can also have quick statistics using the  `summary()` function. As you see in the output, the `summary()`  function adapts the result to the **type** of variable, whether it is a character (no summary for  *name*), a numeric variable (*age*), or a Boolean or logical variable (*student* takes TRUE or FALSE values).  

> This is an important feature of R functions and highlights the importance having the right *type* for the variables used in our analysis.  


```{r, eval=TRUE}
# A summary
summary(mydata)
```

#### A new data.frame 

Consider the  `data.frame`  ***mynewdata*** 

```{r}
mynewdata <-  data.frame(
  name = c("Aldovia", "Borovia", "Corundia", "Dagbon", "Elbonia"),
  area = c(10000, 20000, 15000, 18000, 22000),
  flag_color = c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Purple"),
  english = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
)
```


Play with `mynewdata` (recommended)  and **then** extract the **third** element of the **first** row

```{r prepare-a, exercise.eval = TRUE}
mynewdata <-  data.frame(
  name = c("Aldovia", "Borovia", "Corundia", "Dagbon", "Elbonia"),
  area = c(10000, 20000, 15000, 18000, 22000),
  flag_color = c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Purple"),
  english = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
)
```


```{r extract2,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-a"}
# Enter your solution below


```

```{r extract2-hint-1}
# maybe you could use the head function first
head(mynewdata)

```


```{r extract2-hint-2}
# Now that you have seen the data, you have to extract elements and fill the blanks here:
mynewdata[ , ]

```


```{r extract2-solution}
# Solution : 1 for the row and 3 for column in that order
mynewdata[1,3]
```



> We'll see later on that there are many other ways to play with `data.frames`

## Data exploration

### Data sets operations 
We will use a pre-loaded data set with some SDGs. The name of the data frame is simply `SDG` 

####  The dataset
Before playing with some functions, let's have a look at the variables available in the `SDG` data set using some base R commands. 

First, let us see what are the variables using the `names()` function. 

```{r data, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
names(SDG)
```

Now, can you display the first 5 lines of the data set (maybe using using the  `head()` function) ?


```{r filter2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

**Note:** by default, `head()` shows the **6** first rows! 
*Try maybe with an option (type a comma, inside the function, after the name of the data frame to see some options)*


```{r filter2-solution}
head(SDG, n=5)
```

> That was easy, right? 


### Playing with `tidyverse` 
 There are many functions available in this *meta* package `tidyverse`, in particular, one has many tools for filtering and visualizing the data. 
 
 First, let's examine the `pipe` operator that links operations:  `%>% `. 
 
Imagine we are only interested in the first 3 variables and want to count the number of countries that are in the "Asia" region.

```{r}
# I create a new data frame with only the first 3 variables (note the use of " : " )
df <- SDG[, 1:3]

#Now I want to subset that data to keep only the "Asia" region (note the use of " subset() " )
df <- subset(df, region_name == "Asia" & population >= 50) 

# Counting the number of rows (note the use of " nrow()" )
nrow(df)
```

This requires quite a few lines of code...

>  But there is a quicker and more readable solution


Then `%>% ` links operations in a very easy-to-read sequence. The code below does exactly the same operation as before, but using operation linking using  `%>% `

```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
SDG %>%  
  subset(region_name == "Asia" &  population >= 50) %>%
  nrow()
```

> One may read  `%>% ` as   `next do this (please) ` !

An alternative to `subset()` is the function `filter()` that lets you use a logical test to extract specific rows from a data frame. `filter()` will return every row that passes **each** logical test.


### Test Your Knowledge
We can use many different operations to filter data:

- ==  (identical),  > (strictly greater), >= (greater or equal)   
-  & (and) , | (or) , ! (not) 
- *etc*.


***What will the following code return?** 
  
```{r, eval= FALSE}
SDG %>%  
  filter(region_name == 'Asia' | region_name == "Africa",
         internet_use > 60 ) 
  
```


```{r logicals, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("Every country in either Asia or Africa with internet use greater than 60% ",
                message = " Yes, the filter applies to region_name with  \" | \"  wich means  \" or \" , Excellent!",
                correct = TRUE),
         answer("Every country with a name starting with \"A\" with internet use greater than 50% ",
                message = " No, the filter  applies to region_name  not to country. Try again!  "),
          answer("Every country in either Asia or Africa",
                message = " No, the filter also conditions on internet_use, try again!  "),
         answer("Every country  with internet use greater than 60%  ",
                message = " No, the filter applies also to region_name try again!  "),
         answer("An error. This is an incorrect way to combine tests.",
                message = "No, this code is perfectly fine and use two conditions"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```



### Common mistakes

In R, the order of operations doesn't work like English. You **can't** write `filter(SDG, region_name == "Asia" | "Africa" )`, even though you want all countries that are either in Asia or Africa. 

Here are four more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean operators in R:

###

1. A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to rewrite the code in the question above:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SDG %>%  
 filter(region_name %in% c("Asia", "Africa") , internet_use > 60 ) 
    
```

One may also use some advanced functions such as `str_starts` (*string starts with*), but in our case, the output will include "Americas"

```{r}
SDG %>%  
  filter(str_starts(region_name, 'A') , internet_use > 50 ) 
```

### Exercise 

Use the code chunks below to count the number of countries that:

#### Have a *maternal mortality rate* lower than 12%

    ```{r filterex1, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    
```{r filterex1-solution}
SDG %>% 
  filter(maternal_mortality_ratio <= 12)
```


> Is there a problem in the result ? 

#### Find out wich are the countries with a negative values for *maternal mortality rate* 

```{r filterex2, exercise = TRUE}

```
    

    
```{r filterex2-solution}
# To ease the reading, we use select() to restrict to variables of interest 
SDG %>% 
filter(maternal_mortality_ratio < 0 ) %>%
  select(country, maternal_mortality_ratio)
```

#### Find the number of countries in Asia with a  *maternal mortality rate* lower than 30%? 

```{r filterex3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r filterex3-hint}
# Here there is a problem since we  have duplicates. One may use  distinct() 

SDG %>% 
filter(maternal_mortality_ratio <30 , region_name =="Asia" ) %>%
  select(country, population, maternal_mortality_ratio) 


```

```{r filterex3-solution}
# Solution: We use distinct() in the end to remove duplicates

SDG %>% 
filter(maternal_mortality_ratio <30 , region_name =="Asia" ) %>%
  select(country, population, maternal_mortality_ratio)  %>% 
  distinct() 


```
**Yes** there is a  duplicate problem! Can you solve it? (*see the `hints` to find out*).
