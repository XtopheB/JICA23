## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r summary}
# We load the data from SIAP's server where we stored the .csv file
SouthAfrica <-read.csv2("https://www.unsiap.or.jp/on_line/ML/MLData/ML_SouthAfrica.csv")
```

### Let's look at the variables of the file 

```{r}
names(SouthAfrica)
```

## Exploring singles (or not?)
 In the following chunk, we can select *singles* households (or not) using the variable *z10*  (=1 for *singles* housholds)

```{r}
Mychoice <- 1
Mydata <- SouthAfrica %>%
  filter(z10 == Mychoice) %>%
  select(ltexp, FoodShr) %>%
  arrange(ltexp)

```

## Summaries

```{r}
summary(Mydata)
```
> We can also say that the data set has **`r nrow(Mydata)`** observations with the choice **singles = `r Mychoice`** !

## Including Plots

### Histograms 

Let's first look at the distribution of the two variables.


```{r}
ggplot(Mydata) +
 aes(x = ltexp) +
 geom_histogram(bins = 50L, fill = "pink") +
 labs(title = "Histogram of log(expenditure)", 
 subtitle = "Singles") +
 theme_minimal()

```


```{r}
ggplot(Mydata) +
 aes(x = FoodShr) +
 geom_histogram(bins = 50L, fill = "lightblue") +
 labs(title = "Histogram of Food Share)", 
 subtitle = "Singles") +
 theme_minimal()

```


# Exporing the relationship:

```{r}
Mydata%>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x= ltexp, y= FoodShr) +
  geom_point( color = "darkgrey")+
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r M0-Scatter, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# This how we can do also with "core R" programming

plot(Mydata$FoodShr~Mydata$ltexp,
     main="Scatter plot of Food Share vs Log(exp)", 
     xlab="Log(Exp)",ylab = "FoodShare",
    pch=19, cex = 0.5,col = "grey", frame.plot = FALSE )
```
